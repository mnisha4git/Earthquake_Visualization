# Earthquake Data Visualization using leaflet

Earthquake Data Visualization using leaflet
In this project, I used d3.js, Leaflet.js, Mapbox, and HTML to create a map of earthquake data from the last week. The data was obtained from USGS data as a JSON object. I created a map using a map tile from the Mapbox API, and applied the data to the map using Leaflet.js. I also added markers, popups, and a legend to the map
